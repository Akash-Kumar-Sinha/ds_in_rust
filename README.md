# DSA in rust

- This repository contains the implementation of various data structures and algorithms in rust. The purpose of this repository is to help me learn rust and also to help others who are learning rust.

- I have tried to implement the data structures and algorithms in the most efficient way possible. If you find any mistake or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I will be happy to review it.

- I'm not a expert in rust, so there might be some mistakes in the code.

## Till now I have implemented the following data structures and soon I will be adding more

- [Linked List](src/linked_list.rs) - Implementation inspired by the [Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/) guide.
